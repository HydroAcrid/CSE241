# CSE 241 Final - Kevin Dotel 

# Intro
- Welcome to my database project! In here you can find assumptions, a walk through of what I want you to input and other useful resources 

# Assumptions
- Any tenant can pay off the rent for their apartment. Rent is not divided amongst them, so as long as they're on the lease they see the entire bill.
- Because emails must be unique in my database, tenant  authentication is based on their email address.

# How to run without creating a jar (MAC)
1. Make you sure you are in the "Final" Directory 
2. Run: javac -d . -cp "ked225Dotel/lib/*" $(find ked225Dotel -name "*.java")
3. Run: java -cp ".:ked225Dotel/lib/*" Final.ked225Dotel.main
